// Admission journal for synchronizing schedulers across ranks (DESIGN §11).
// Rank 0 accepts HTTP requests and sends newline-framed JSON over a TCP star:
//
//   {"op":"settings", ...}       model, world and engine settings, sent first
//   {"op":"warm","adm":{...},"pc":N,"cfg":"<digest>"}
//   {"op":"tick","s":[{"id":"…","p":[ids],"m":N,"b":[...],"nc":1}],"c":["id"],"pd":D,"od":F}
//   {"op":"stop"}
//
// The settings record precedes model construction. Warm supplies admission
// settings and prefix slot count, checks the configuration digest and
// coordinates graph warm capture before the first tick. A tick carries
// accepted submissions and cancellations; p contains token IDs, b the
// prompt boundaries and nc the cache opt-out flag. Rejected HTTP requests
// stay on rank 0. Tokens, retirements and cache decisions are derived by
// each scheduler from the same inputs.
//
// Rank 0 broadcasts each tick after draining submissions and before calling
// sched.tick(). Peers apply the record and execute that tick. Collectives
// keep engine operations aligned, so stop and subsequent records are
// handled between ticks. A peer rejecting an admitted request is a fatal
// scheduler divergence.
//
// od is rank 0's FNV-1a operation-stream fold after the previous tick; pd
// is its prefix-decision digest. Peers compare their own values before
// applying the record and report the tick on a mismatch. Shutdown hashes
// compare the complete streams.
//
// Journal watches detect socket closure even while an engine is inside a
// collective. Rank 0 fails active streams after their completed tokens;
// peers exit on loss of rank 0. The bus watchdog handles silent node loss.
// There is no failover within a running world.
