// Resident weight loader for the GLM text model (M4 deliverable 2,
// DESIGN §4). Loads one layer at a time from the mapped checkpoint into
// DEVICE memory through a pinned staging mirror (see GlmLayerBump for why
// not managed), transformed into the exact layouts the M2/M3 layer
// kernels consume: merged KDA in_proj ([f_a|g_a|q|k|v|b] rows) and conv
// (q|k|v channels), fused DSA qkv_a, F32 indexer APE. The E4M3+scale pairs
// of the MLP/MoE matrices stay resident in compressed form — "load" never
// means a persistent BF16 expansion of the model. The four DSA attention
// matrices (q_a, kv_a, q_b, o_proj) are dequantized per layer as a
// documented TRANSIENT bridge for the M3 IGemm interface (bf16 weights); the M4
// scale-aware GEMM replaces that bridge.
//
// Streaming model (M4 deliverable 4): exactly one layer is resident at a
// time — a bump allocation reset per load, sized to the largest layer.
// Globals (embed/lm_head/final norm) load once and persist. Peak device
// memory is therefore largest-layer + globals, which is what makes
// full-model correctness testable on a single node without the TP placement.
//
// RESIDENT model (the production residency contract, DESIGN §3, M6 d5 —
// implemented M5 ahead of the serving integration): GlmResidency::Resident
// materializes each layer ONCE into its own exact-formula bump and keeps
// it for the stream's lifetime — storage is never touched again after a
// layer's first load. load_layer on a materialized layer returns the
// cached view with NO sync (the loader wrote nothing; the streaming
// contract's sync exists to cover loader WRITES) and NO storage reads
// (source_bytes_read stops growing — glm_stream_check's second pass is
// the contract's proof). release_layer is a no-op so existing call sites
// (the model's preconstruct pass) stay correct unchanged. resident_bytes()
// is the exact formula total, so callers can refuse a world that cannot
// fit BEFORE the first allocation: only TP=4 fits 128 GB at real dims
// (~79 GiB weights/rank, ~49 GB headroom; TP=2 and TP=1 cannot — the
// memory rationale for the four-rank deployment target).
//
// Sharded build (M5 d4): world>1 produces the resident layer directly at
// this rank's TP geometry — the same layouts GlmTpViews::bind would carve
// from a full layer, pinned bitwise by glm_tp_test's shard-parity test.
// world=1 stays the degenerate rank 0 (the M4 build, byte-for-byte).
//
// Synchronization contract: load_layer/load_globals cudaDeviceSynchronize
// before returning, so the weights are readable by device work issued
// afterwards; the resident pointers are DEVICE addresses (cudaMemcpy them
// to inspect from the host) and must not be overwritten while GPU work runs.
